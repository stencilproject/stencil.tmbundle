# stencil.tmbundle

TextMate bundle for the [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil) template language.

This bundle was created to support a [Visual Studio code extension](https://github.com/svanimpe/vscode-stencil). It contains a grammar, snippets and indentation rules. I am making it available primarily to enable support for Stencil in other editors and IDEs.
